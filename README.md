# Marching Cubes Engine

⚠ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠

This project is a 3D visualization engine using the Marching Cubes algorithm, implemented in C++ and OpenGL. It is designed to generate and visualize terrain meshes, as well as scanned and recognized models of human faces or terrain, using OpenCV datasets.

## Features

- Implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm for terrain and face mesh generation
- Integration with OpenCV for face and terrain recognition
- Real-time rendering of meshes in OpenGL
- Ability to handle near-real-time updates for dynamic meshes

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler
- OpenGL library
- OpenCV library
