# Marching Cubes Engine

⚠ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠

This project is a 3D visualization engine using the Marching Cubes algorithm, implemented in C++ and OpenGL. It is designed to generate and visualize terrain meshes, as well as scanned and recognized models of human faces or terrain, using OpenCV datasets.

The Engine of environment is based on <learnopengl.com>

## Features

- Implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm for terrain and face mesh generation
- Integration with OpenCV for face and terrain recognition
- Real-time rendering of meshes in OpenGL
- Ability to handle near-real-time updates for dynamic meshes

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler
- OpenGL library
- OpenCV library
